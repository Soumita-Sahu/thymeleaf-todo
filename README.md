# Todo List Application

## Overview
This is a simple yet functional Todo List web application developed using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. The application demonstrates the use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to dynamically render web pages with server-side data binding. Users can view a list of tasks with details such as title, description, and completion status.

## Features
- Displays a list of Todo items in a styled HTML table.
- Clearly distinguishes completed and pending tasks using color coding.
- Utilizes Thymeleaf templating engine for seamless integration of Java objects into HTML views.
- Responsive and clean UI design with basic CSS styling placed in the static resources folder.

## Technologies Used
- Java 23
- Spring Boot 3.5.0
- Thymeleaf 3.1.3
- Maven for dependency management
- HTML5 and CSS3 for frontend styling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This README provides a clear, professional overview and instructions to anyone looking at your project. You can attach the screenshot (named something like `todo-list-output.png`) to your repo root or a `/screenshots` folder for clarity.

Would you like me to help format it as a Markdown README.md instead?
